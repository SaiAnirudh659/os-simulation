# Operating System Simulation

This project simulates core concepts of Operating Systems by implementing different process scheduling algorithms and laying the foundation for memory management, deadlock handling, and file system basics.

## 🚀 Project Goal
To build simple yet functional simulations that demonstrate how an Operating System manages processes and system resources, using classic Computer Science algorithms.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Platform:** macOS (VS Code Terminal)

## 📂 Repository Structure

/src /process_scheduling - fcfs.py - sjf.py - round_robin.py - priority.py /memory_management /deadlock_handling /file_system /tests - test_fcfs.py - test_sjf.py - test_round_robin.py - test_priority.py /docs - (Documentation for modules) /README.md

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository and explore different OS modules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/os-simulation.git
cd os-simulation

Built with ❤️ for learning core Computer Science concepts and operating system fundamentals.

✅ **Why this is better:**
- Shows exactly what scheduling algorithms are implemented ✅
- Clear structure for someone cloning it ✅
- Gives **sample commands** to run modules and tests ✅
- Looks clean and professional if someone visits your GitHub page ✅

# ✨ So, action items:

- Copy and replace your old README.md with this one.
- Customize `https://github.com/your-username/os-simulation.git` → your real GitHub username.
- Then:
  ```bash
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Updated README with scheduling algorithms and usage instructions"
  git push
